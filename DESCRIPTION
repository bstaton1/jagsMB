Description: Provides lightweight facilities to build up large JAGS models
  that are comprised of smaller, potentially swappable, components. 
  Because every JAGS model fitted requires a model definition, analyses that
  involve to reproducibly comparing many models must manage many model files.
  This typically requires repetition and wasted time making changes to the
  same code found in multiple model definitions. With the 'jagsMB' workflow, 
  the user defines JAGS model within R functions, combines them according to 
  customized rules into a list to be passed through a check, build, and
  write pipeline. After the model is exported to a file, tools are provided to 
  print specific line numbers, search it for regex matches, and replace specific
  lines.
